Add the salt and stir to incorporate. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until it comes together in a soft ball, adding more flour as needed. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. On a surface dusted with powdered sugar, roll out the dough with a rolling pin to a -inch (3 mm) thick round. Cut the dough into about 8 3-inch rounds. Transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Bake the rounds for 15 minutes, or until dry looking and firm. Let cool for 10 minutes. Make the chocolate crust: Wrap the bottom of an 8-inch (20 cm) springform pan with foil. Transfer the cooled cookie rounds to a food processor and pulse until broken down into coarse crumbs. Add the powdered sugar and pulse to incorporate. Add the melted butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse sand. Transfer the crumbs to the prepared pan and press evenly against the bottom. Chill the crust in the refrigerator until ready to fill. Make the dark caramel sauce: Add the sugar to a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until the sugar melts into a thick, amber-colored liquid, 3-5 minutes. Do not let the sugar burn. Add the butter and whisk until completely melted. Reduce the heat to medium-low and slowly add the heavy cream. Let the mixture boil for 1 minute, then add vanilla and stir to incorporate. Transfer the caramel to a heatproof bowl and let cool to room temperature. Make the filling: Preheat the oven to 325F (163C). In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the cream cheese and beat until smooth. Add the sour cream and beat to combine, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the sugar and beat to incorporate. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating to incorporate each addition before adding the next. Add the vanilla and white chocolate and beat to combine. Add the melted chocolate to a medium bowl. Add  cup (145 G) of the caramel sauce to a separate medium bowl, reserving the remaining caramel sauce for serving. Add 2 cups (550 G) of the cheesecake filling to each bowl and stir with a rubber spatula until well combined. Pour the chocolate layer into the center of the prepared pan and smooth into an even layer. Slowly pour the caramel layer over the chocolate layer and smooth the top. Slowly pour the white chocolate layer over the caramel layer and smooth the top. Set the springform pan in a large roasting pan. Carefully pour in boiling water, taking care not to splash into the cheesecake, until it reaches about 1 inch (2  cm) up the sides of the springform pan. Carefully transfer the roasting pan to the oven and bake the cheesecake for about 2 hours, or until set. Remove the cheesecake from the oven. Carefully lift the springform pan from the water bath. Transfer to the refrigerator to chill overnight. Make the candied pecans: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium pan over medium-high heat, combine the water, sugar, and corn syrup. Cook for 35 minutes, until glossy. Add the pecans and cook, stirring constantly, until glazed, 23 minutes. Pour the pecans onto the prepared pan and separate so they dont clump together. Let cool completely. To assemble, unwrap the foil from the springform pan and release the springform. Warm the reserved caramel sauce.

In a large bowl, mix flour, salt, pepper, and herbs together. Once incorporated, create a small well in the middle and pour in the water/yeast/oil mixture. Mix by hand, wetting your working hand before mixing so the dough doesnt stick to your fingers. The water and flour should come together and form a rough dough that pulls away from the sides of the bowl. NOTE: If the dough is too sticky, add more flour in small increments, about 1 tablespoon at a time. If the dough is too dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Once the dough begins to come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead the dough until it forms a smooth ball. Coat the bowl the dough was initially mixed in with about a tablespoon of olive oil and place the dough ball inside. Give it a few turns to coat the dough in the oil. Cover and let the dough rise until it doubles in size about 1 hour. While the dough rises, prepare a large baking sheet by generously coating it with olive oil. Once the dough has risen, turn it out onto the prepared baking sheet and flatten it out into a large rectangle. Using a knife or dough scraper, cut the dough into 4 evenly sized rectangles. Press the rectangles flat and arrange them with each one pressed into a corner of the baking sheet. Cover and let the dough rest for 20 to 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450F (230C) while the dough is resting. Depending on the temperature of your kitchen and activeness of the yeast, the 4 rectangles should have risen to be about an 1-inch (2  cm) thick. Using your fingers, poke the the dough all over--creating small dimples across the surface. Generously coat the tops of the dough rectangles one last time with olive oil (some oil will pool inside of the divots we made with our fingers. Thats ok!) Use a basting brush to ensure all of the dough gets covered with olive oil. Top the dough rectangles with your choice of toppings.

Place each tied knot on a baking sheet or casserole dish with high sides, nestling them close together in a 4x4 in  (10x10-cm) grid. Once all the knots are placed in the dish, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 400F (200C). Uncover and bake for 12 minutes or until the slider buns are golden brown and no doughy grey bits remain. Once the knots are out of the oven, lower the oven temperature to 350F (180C). Allow the knots to cool, carefully remove them from the baking dish and cut the grid horizontally,creating both a top and bottom piece. NOTE: Its helpful to hold the knots together with a towel on top while cutting them horizontally, as the motion of the knife might cause some of them to pull apart. Return the bottom half of the knot-grid to the original baking dish. Evenly layer the bread with cooked chicken, followed by the pesto and mozzarella cheese.

Pour the milk into a small saucepan, and sprinkle over the cornstarch, whisk until combined. Next, add the honey and sugar stirring continuously over a low heat. When the milk mixture almost starts to boil it will thicken and get a bit lumpy, don't panic! Just keep stirring until it smooths out. Continue to stir the now thick milk mixture over the heat for an additional 1-2 minutes, to cook out the cornstarch flavor. Take off the heat and pour into a bowl or shallow dish. Cover the mixture with cling wrap, pushing it all the way to the top of the custard to prevent a film from forming and chill this in the refrigerator until cold. Next, make the cake by combining the sugar, honey, matcha powder, and eggs in a large bowl. Mix until it almost triples in size, is lighter in color, and becomes thick and fluffy. This will take about 7-10 minutes. If you dribble some of the batter on itself it should hold a \\\"ribbon\\\" shape for 4-5 seconds. Once the batter has reached the correct consistency sift over the cake flour, and gently fold the flour in until all combined. Heat your oven to 350F (175C) and butter your baking sheet. Place a piece of parchment paper (a few inches larger than your baking sheet) onto your baking sheet. Using a rubber scraper (or your hand) push out any bubbles. Pour the batter into the prepared baking sheet and bake for 8-10 minutes. NOTE: You'll know it's done when the cake is slightly risen, turning just a bit golden, and you can smell it. Also, if you gently press your fingertips on the surface of the cake, and no indentations are left, it's done. In a clean bowl, whip the heavy cream with electric beaters until it is thick and pretty stiff, little peaks should form when you lift the beaters. Grab your chilled custard from the fridge. Add one tsp of vanilla extract. Take the same beaters and whisk your custard, it will look funny at first, but after a few moments it will become nice and smooth. Fold the whipped cream into the custard until they are combined. Cool your cake for 2-3 minutes on the baking sheet.

Let sit for 5 minutes, until the yeast has bloomed. NOTE: It may be tempting to use all whole wheat flour in this recipe, but, in our testing, that method resulted in dense, tough, squat breads that barely rose when we tried to proof them.  Using some all-purpose flour was necessary to give us the rise and soft, pillowy texture we wanted in a good sandwich bread. Pour in the wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oil, and salt, and mix until the dough comes together in a ball that does not stick to your fingers. NOTE: You can also do the first 2 steps in a standing mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, mixing on low speed until the dough no longer sticks to the sides. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few times until it really starts to form a tight ball. Form the dough into a ball shape and transfer to a greased bowl, turning the dough to coat it in grease. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a wet towel and store in a warm place for 1 hour. Allow the dough to proof until it has doubled in size. Save the plastic wrap or towel as youll be using it again. Transfer the proofed dough to a lightly floured surface and press the dough  dont stretch  into a 7x7-inch (18x18 cm) square. Fold the top 3rd of the square down, and the bottom 3rd up to form an even rectangle. Pinch the top fold to seal the dough. Roll the dough over so that the seal faces upward and fold both ends up toward the center, so that the dough has formed an even log shape about the size of your loaf pan. Transfer the dough to a greased loaf pan and cover with with the same plastic wrap or towel used before. Let the dough rise for 1 hour, until it has poofed over the edge of the loaf pan about 1 inches (4 cm). Preheat the oven to 375F (190C). Remove the plastic wrap or towel and transfer to the oven and bake for 50-55 minutes, until the dough has browned slightly and formed a light brown crust. Immediately remove the loaf from the pan and set aside to cool for at least 1 hour before slicing. Store in an airtight container or bag. The bread can be stored in freezer up to 6 months.

Stir with a rubber spatula to dissolve the starter. Add the bread flour and whole wheat flour. Use a spatula or your clean hands to mix until combined and there are no dry spots. Cover with a clean cotton kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place for 60 minutes. Bulk fermentation: After resting the dough, add the salt and remaining 10 grams water. Use your hands to incorporate the salt, squishing the dough through your fingers to make sure it is evenly distributed. Set a bowl of water nearby. Once the salt is incorporated, dip your hand in the water to prevent sticking. Use your wet hand to stretch the dough from the edge of the bowl upwards, then fold toward the center. Repeat a total of 8 times, rotating the bowl slightly after each fold. After the folds, carefully lift the dough up, flip it over, place it back in the bowl and tuck the edges under the dough. Scrape down the edges of the bowl, then cover with the kitchen towel and let rest in a warm place for 60 minutes. Repeat the stretching and folding process 2 more times, waiting 60 minutes after each folding session before beginning again. You should see signs of fermentation in the form of an increase in volume and bubbles along the edges and top of the dough. Wait a little longer, up to 30 more minutes between folds, if you dont see those signs yet. Preshape: An hour after the final stretch and fold, dip your hands in the water. Think of the dough as the face of a clock. Slide your hands into the bowl at 3 oclock and 9 oclock. Partially lift the dough from the bowl and let it fold under itself. Rotate the bowl and repeat the lifting and fold under 5-6 times, until dough has begun to come together in a ball. Carefully lift the dough onto a clean surface. Lightly sprinkle the dough with the dusting flour. Using a bench scraper, or lightly floured hands, carefully rotate and drag the dough towards yourself along the surface, building tension until you have a round, taut ball of dough. Do not make the ball too tight, as it may tear. Lightly flour the dough, cover with the towel, and let rest for 3040 minutes. Final shape: Dust a proofing basket or a medium bowl lined with a cotton towel lightly with flour. After 40 minutes, the dough should look relaxed and have spread out slightly. Lightly flour the top of the dough again. Using the bench scraper, or a silicone spatula and lightly floured hands, carefully flip the dough over, so the unfloured part is facing upwards. Think of the clock again. Fold in 12 oclock towards the center, then 6 oclock, 3 oclock, and 9 oclock, then each of the remaining 4 diagonal corners. Carefully transfer the dough, seam-side up, to the prepared proofing basket or bowl. Pinch the seams to ensure they are sealed. Cover the bowl with the towel. Final proof: Transfer the dough to the refrigerator to finish proofing overnight, 1218 hours. If you want to bake the same day, leave at room temperature for 23 hours, then transfer to the refrigerator while you preheat the oven. (Overnight proofing is highly recommended!) When you are ready to bake, preheat the oven to 500F (260C). Place a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker in the oven while it preheats. Make sure your oven has come up to temperature before baking, at least 30 minutes. Prepare a piece of parchment paper about the size of the bottom of your baking vessel. Place the parchment over the proofing basket and gently flip the basket over so the dough drops onto the parchment. Carefully remove the baking vessel from the oven. Use the parchment paper to carefully lift the dough into the pan. Use a sharp paring knife or bread lame to slash the top of the dough a few times. This scoring will allow steam to escape. Cover the vessel with the lid and carefully place in the oven. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the lid and reduce the oven temperature to 450F (230C). Continue baking for another 1520 minutes, until the crust is amber brown. Remove the bread from the oven and carefully transfer to a wire rack. Check to make sure it is done baking by tapping on the bottom--you should hear a hollow sound. Though it may be tempting to dive right in, let the bread cool completely, at least 2 hours, before slicing with a serrated knife. Store the loaf cut-side down on a cutting board, or in a plastic bag. You can freeze the whole loaf, or pre-slice, then freeze and pull out slices as needed. Notes: If you are using all-purpose flour, use 375 grams of water instead of 400 grams of water for the initial mix. If you dont have a Dutch oven or cast iron combo cooker, you could bake in a cast iron skillet, a pizza stone or a sheet pan, uncovered. You could also bake the bread in a greased 9 x 5-inch (22 x 12 cm) loaf pan (place the bread in the pan seam-side down instead of in a proofing basket.) Bake at 475F (240C) for 4045 minutes, until amber brown. Reduce the oven temperature for the last 20 minutes of baking if the bread is getting too dark on top. The bread wont look as shiny and have as crispy of a crust, but will taste just as good!

Set aside. In a medium or large saucepan, add the butter and melt over medium heat. The larger the pan you use, the quicker the process will be! Bring the butter to a boil, stirring frequently. As the water begins to boil out of the butter, the milk solids in the butter will separate, sink to the bottom, and begin to toast and brown. As this begins to happen, make sure to stir constantly so the butter browns evenly. It may become quite foamy, splatter a bit, and be difficult to see, so keep a close eye on it, removing from heat and continuing to stir if it starts to foam over. Once the butter has turned a nice nutty brown, remove from the heat and pour into a large liquid measuring cup to stop the cooking. Allow it to cool down for a minute or two, give it a stir, and carefully add 2-3 tablespoons of water to the butter to bring it back up to 1 cup (240 ml) of liquid. Set aside to cool to room temperature. To help speed this process up, you can place in the fridge for 10-15 minutes. You want to make sure the butter is still liquid when youre adding it to the dough later on, so make sure to remove after 15 minutes. In a large bowl, add the sugars, vanilla, espresso powder, and cooled brown butter. Cream together with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy, 1-2 minutes. Add the egg and yolk and beat until incorporated. Add the dry ingredients, about  of the mixture at a time, and beat between additions until just incorporated.

Flip and cook on the other side until deep brown, 5 minutes more. Remove the tofu from the pan.

Working 2 at a time, fry the chicken for 34 minutes, until deep golden brown and crispy. Transfer the chicken to a wire rack and season lightly with salt. Bring the oil temperature back to 350F (180C) between batches. To assemble, spread 1 tablespoon of aioli across the bottom of each toasted brioche bun.

Preheat the oven to 375F (200C). On a floured surface, cut the pie dough in half and roll out both halves until round and about -inch (3 mm) thick. Roll the dough around the rolling pin and unroll onto a pie dish making sure the dough reaches all edges. Trim extra if necessary. Pour in apple filling mixture and pat down. Roll the other half of the dough on top. Trim the extra dough from the edges and pinch the edges to create a crimp. Make sure edges are sealed together. Brush the pie with the beaten egg and sprinkle with the sugar. Cut four slits in the top of the pie to create a vent. Bake pie for 50-60 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and no greyish or undercooked pastry remains. Allow to cool completely before slicing. Top with ice cream and serve.

Add cream cheese, melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and sugar to a large bowl and whisk, either by hand or with an electric mixer, until all the ingredients are incorporated.

Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the powdered sugar, 1 cup at a time, until incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to high and whip until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes more. Add the crushed pineapple, salt, and vanilla and whip for another 30 seconds, or until incorporated. Transfer the frosting to a piping bag fitted with a star tip, then pipe onto the cooled cupcakes. Garnish each cupcake with a slice of fresh and candied pineapple. Enjoy!

Grease a roll cake baking pan or 18 x 13-inch (45 x 33 cm) baking sheet with nonstick spray and line with parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 3 tablespoons of sugar until the sugar is dissolved. Whisk in the milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla until smooth. Sift in the flour, cocoa powder, and cornstarch and whisk until smooth. In a large bowl with an electric hand mixer, or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the egg whites on medium speed until frothy, about 2 minutes. Add the cream of tartar and whip on medium-low speed for 2 minutes, then gradually add the remaining  cup (100 G) superfine sugar. Whip on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form, another 23 minutes. Fold the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture until just combined, taking care not to overmix. Spread the batter evenly on the prepared pan. Bake for 1215 minutes, until fluffy and the cake springs back when gently pressed. Drape a kitchen towel over the cake and set a wire rack on top. Carefully invert the cake onto the rack, peel back the parchment from the bottom, and let cool for 10 minutes. Carefully roll the cake into a log with the towel inside and allow to cool completely. While the cake cools, make the chocolate hazelnut buttercream: In a large bowl, beat the butter and powdered sugar with an electric hand mixer on low speed until combined. Increase the speed to high and whip for 23 minutes, until light and fluffy. Reduce the speed to low and add the milk, vanilla, and salt. Whip again for 23 minutes until well incorporated and the buttercream is light, bright white, and fluffy. Fold in the chocolate-hazelnut spread with a rubber spatula. Cover with a kitchen towel or place wrap and set aside at room temperature. Make the ganache: Place the chopped chocolate in a medium bowl. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate. Stir until the chocolate is melted. Refrigerate the ganache for at least 30 minutes to firm. Make the meringue mushrooms: Reduce the oven temperature to 200F (93C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a medium bowl, beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with an electric hand mixer until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Gradually add the sugar and whip until dissolved and stiff peaks form, about 2 minutes more. The mixture should be glossy, shiny, and very stiff. Transfer the mixture to a piping bag fitted with a medium round tip. Pipe half of the meringue onto the prepared baking sheet in 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide circles resembling mushroom caps. Use your fingers to gently press down any peaks. Pipe the remaining meringue into 1 inch (2.54 cm) long stems. Dust the mushrooms with cocoa powder. Bake for 12 hours, until the mushrooms are completely dried and hard to the touch. Turn off the oven and leave the mushrooms dry out in the oven for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight. The mushrooms can be made 1-2 days ahead. Assemble the mushrooms: Dip the flat sides of the mushroom caps in the melted chocolate and attach the mushroom stems. Stand the mushrooms upright and let dry, 3045 minutes. Make the sugared cranberries and rosemary: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and top with a wire rack. In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup (200 G) sugar and the water. Bring to a boil, whisking to dissolve the sugar. Drop the cranberries into the syrup and stir to coat, then remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to one side of the wire rack. Let cool for at least 1 hour, until no longer sticky, then sprinkle cranberries with  cup (25 G) sugar. Set aside. Bring the remaining syrup to a boil. Add the rosemary sprigs and stir to coat, then remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to the other side of the wire rack. Let cool for at least 1 hour, then sprinkle rosemary with the remaining  cup (25 G) sugar. Set aside. Assemble the bche de nol: Unroll the sponge cake. Spread 2 cups (230 G) of the chocolate-hazelnut buttercream. evenly over the cake, leaving a 1-inch (2.54 cm) border around all sides. Starting from one end, using the towel to help guide the rolling, roll the cake into a tight spiral. Place the cake, seam-side down, in the refrigerator to set, at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight. Unwrap the cake log from the towel and set on a serving platter. Remove the ganache from the fridge and transfer to a piping bag fitted with a medium star tip. Trim 2 inches (6 cm) ( off one end of the cake log and attach to the center of the log with 2 tablespoons of the ganache to resemble a stump. Cover the entire log, starting at one end and piping lengthwise, with ganache. Arrange the sugared rosemary and cranberries and meringue mushrooms around the log. Dust with powdered sugar to resemble snow. The cake will keep in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 3 days. Slice and serve.
