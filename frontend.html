            <p class="description-text">Inspired by our love for food and cooking, we collected recipes from <a href="https://tasty.co/">Tasty website</a>. The elements we scraped include recipe title, description, ingredients, and preparation steps. We collected around 2000 recipes. 
                However, due to limited budget, we were only able to annotate 800 of them. 
                Our annotations are divided into five categories: Appetizer/side-dish, Main course, Dessert, Drinks, and Other. To explore more, please feel free to play around with our page by searching ingredients or food related key words and filter your search result using the drop down menu. Curious how we used our annotated data for predicting food category? please check out our Machine Learning page.

            <p>Inspired by our love for food and cooking, we collected recipes from <a href="https://tasty.co/">Tasty website</a>. The elements we scraped include recipe title, description, ingredients, and preparation steps. We collected around 2000 recipes. However, due to limited budget, we were only able to annotate 800 of them. Our annotations are divided into five categories: Appetizer/side-dish, Main course, Dessert, Drinks, and Other.
                <br> 
                <br>We used Amazon Mechanical Turk annotate the recipes  based on tge categeries and for each recipe, we assign it to three different workers. Then, we extracted the best annotation if two annotators agree on one category. We investigated the inter-annotator agreement and we chose to use Krippendorff’s phi and alpha here because we have five categories(Appetizers/Side dish, Main course, Dessert, Drinks and Other). Based on Krippendorff’s alpha result, the observed disagreement is high (57.375%). The alpha is around 0.42, below the lowest conceivable limit (0.667), and falls into the range of (0.41, 0.6) as being moderate.
                <br> 
                <br>We think that this project has a lot of future possible developments. One of the possible developments is that we can add more models in addition to existing machine learning model so that we can compare performances of different models. 
                Another idea for future work is that we can extract ingredients of these recipes that commonly triggers allergy and have a column that shows potential allergy warnings for the recipes. 
                Lastly, we can develop a calorie counter and have a feature where users can filter recipes based on the calories.
